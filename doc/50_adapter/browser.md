# Browser Adapter

Note: this file is very preliminary, it is just a bunch of ideas.

## Architecture

The browser adapter has two operating modes:

1. Inline → the adapter runs in the browser main thread.
2. Worker → the adapter runs in a worker.

The worker mode of the browser adapter requires cross-origin isolation.

### Inline mode architecture

```text
[Browser main thread]
    └─ [Event handler]
         ├─ Encode the browser event to binary representation in an `ArrayBuffer`.
         ├─ Run a frame (a call into WASM)
         ├─ Decode the UI patching operations from binary representation in an `ArrayBuffer`.
         └─ [Animation frame callback]
             └─ Apply UI patching operations
```

### Worker mode architecture

**User/network event handling**

```text
[Browser main thread]
    └─ [Outer event handler]
         ├─ Transform the browser event to binary representation in a `SharedArrayBuffer`.
         └─ Send a message to the Drain Worker that contains (offset, size and sequence) of the event in the `SharedArrayBuffer`.     
      ↓
[Event collector worker]
    └─ [Inner event handler]
         ├─ Put event (offset, size and sequence) into a round-robin queue.
         └─ Notify the Frame Worker.
      ↓   
[Frame worker]
    └─ [Frame processing loop]
         ├─ If the event queue is not empty go on, otherwise wait for a notification from the Event collector worker.
         ├─ Run a frame → processes all events in the round-robin queue.
         ├─ Transform UI patching operations into binary representation in a `SharedArrayBuffer`.
         └─ Send a message to the Browser main thread that contains (offset, size and sequence) of the patch in the `SharedArrayBuffer`.
```

Note: there are two workers because it provides a way to drain the event queue. Without two independent workers events
would have to be processed in one-by-one.

**Patch message handling**

```text
[Browser main thread]
    └─ [Patch event handler]
         └─ [Animation frame callback]
             └─ Apply UI patching operations
```

#### Data structures

There are two `SharedArrayBuffer`s:

1. One for events from the browser to the frame worker: `event SAB`.
2. One for UI patching operations from the frame worker to the browser: `patch SAB`.

The event collector worker and the frame worker share the queue of events.

#### Synchronization

Messages sent using `postMessage` store:

- offset and size of the data in the `SharedArrayBuffer`
- sequence number of the message
- current write pointer in the **other** `SharedArrayBuffer`

The workers advance write pointers as they process messages. They only advance
when they get it in a message, so it is ensured that the other worker already
processed the data.

**Sending and receiving algorithm**

- Producer (writer):
    - Write the payload bytes into the SAB.
    - Write the sequence number into the SAB with Atomics.store — this is a release.
    - Send a message carrying (offset, size, sequence) to the consumer (or write to the round-robin queue and notify).
- Consumer (reader), upon receiving the message or a notification:
    - Read the sequence number with Atomics.load — this is an acquire.
    - Read and process payload.

### Backpressure

- The browser main thread drops events if there is not enough space in the `event SAB` (all events until space is available).
- The frame worker waits for enough space in the `patch SAB` before emitting a patch.
- There is no event coalescing.
